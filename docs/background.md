# Why am I making this?
I am a web developer and electrical engineer with an interest in urbanism and transit. For cities, geometry dictates that the only way out of congestion and pollution is with mass transit. I have always wanted to work on projects that make this a more painless, easy experience for people. For those that rely on transit, we know that one of the first things you check before leaving is when the next bus or train is coming so you don't head out too early or too late. This project aims to make that accessing information as simple as glancing at your wall. 

# Why not just use a LCD display?
Well, yes, a computer monitor or TV would probably provide more information, be easier to manage, and everyone has one. But it's not the kind of thing most people want to have sitting on a coffee table or mounted on the living room wall. This project aims to satisfy a certain aesthetic that isn't met by a computer monitor with fancy graphics. It's meant to emulate the appearance of a display you would see in a transit station. 

# Why not just check the status on your phone? 
Most people do this, but it requires opening an app and refreshing the status of your buses. To truly integrate mass transit into your life, it becomes necessary to have that information always accessible.
